The [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com/) is a professional-grade, scalable Flash game engine built for industry-quality games. It is built upon modern Flash programming practices, allowing you to focus on making your game awesome! It comes built-in with a "platformer" starter-kit, which you can use to easily make awesome 2D or 3D sidescrolling games.

The [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com/) is not only made for platformer games, but for all type of games. It offers a nice way to separate logic/physics from art.

It offers many options, you may use :
- select between : the classic flash display list, blitting, [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/) and [Away3D](http://away3d.com/).
- select between : [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/manual.html), [Nape](http://deltaluca.me.uk/docnew/), [AwayPhysics](https://github.com/away3d/awayphysics-core-fp11) and a Simple math based collision detection.
- a simple way to manage object creation, and for advanced developers : an entity/component system and object pooling.
- a LevelManager and a LoadManager which may use Flash Pro as a level editor.
- a Console, Sound management class, Keyboard and input handler...
